# greenhousePi
The goal of this project is to automate a hydroponic system. Sensors that are immersed inside the hydroponic tubing measure things like PH, temperature, and water flow. Based on these readings my goal is to make it so the rasberry pi automatically responds to low or high readings and makes a change to the system without human intervention.
